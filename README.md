# OOP3200-JavaLab3
This lab was a collaboration between Daniel Hinbest and Ryan Clayson in Object-Oriented Programming II (OOP 3200) at Durham College. The purpose of this lab is the same as C++ Lab 3 from earlier in the semester. Based off of Java Lab 2, we had to create a new ExtendedWorkTicket class that inherits from WorkTicket and create an isOpen attribute.
